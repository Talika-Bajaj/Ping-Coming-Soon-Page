# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

![Design preview for the Ping coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 20th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

This coding challenge has been invaluable in refining my CSS layout skills, i.e. CSS Flex Layout and CSS Grid Layout techniques. In addition, for robust form validation, I implemented regular expressions to verify entered email addresses. If the input doesn't conform to the required pattern, an error message elegantly prompts the user for correction.

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
